# Chorus

A native macOS app that unifies your web services — Gmail, Slack, Discord,
Notion, ChatGPT, and more — into one window, each with its own fully isolated
session. A lightweight, WebKit-based alternative to Chromium apps like Rambox
and Franz, built for Apple Silicon.

> Status: pre-1.0 MVP. Core flows are solid and covered by tests; see
> [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for recent work.

## Features

- **Isolated sessions per service.** Each service gets its own
  `WKWebsiteDataStore`, so you can stay signed into two Gmail accounts (or a
  personal and work Slack) side by side with no cookie leakage.
- **Spaces.** Group services into spaces (e.g. 🏠 Personal, 💼 Work). A service
  can live in more than one space; sessions stay isolated per instance.
- **Badges & notifications.** Unread counts surface on the dock and per-space
  chips via title/DOM polling and intercepted web `Notification`s. Per-service
  and per-space mute, plus global Do Not Disturb.
- **Memory-aware hibernation.** Least-recently-used services hibernate to
  reclaim memory and wake instantly where you left off; pin "Keep loaded"
  services that should never sleep.
- **Quick switcher** (`⌘K`), **find in page** (`⌘F`), **zoom** (`⌘+`/`⌘-`/`⌘0`),
  reload (`⌘R`), and drag-to-reorder services and spaces.
- **Smart link routing.** Cross-service links open in a matching Chorus service
  when one exists, otherwise in your default browser.
- **Resilient.** Pauses polling when offline or asleep, recovers from WebContent
  crashes with backoff, and never deletes your data without consent.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later
- Xcode 15+ / Swift 5.9+
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonsm/XcodeGen) (`brew install xcodegen`) — the
  Xcode project is generated from `project.yml`

## Build & run

```sh
# Regenerate the Xcode project after changing project.yml or adding files
xcodegen generate

# Build and run the test suite from the CLI
xcodebuild test -project Chorus.xcodeproj -scheme Chorus -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

Or open `Chorus.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run the **Chorus** scheme.

## Project layout

| Path | What |
|------|------|
| `Chorus/App/` | App entry point and `AppState` (central coordinator) |
| `Chorus/Models/` | SwiftData models — `ServiceInstance`, `Space`, `SpaceServiceLink`, `AppPreferences` |
| `Chorus/Services/` | Badges, notifications, polling, data stores, catalog, networking |
| `Chorus/Views/` | SwiftUI views — main window, sidebar, web view pool, settings, sheets |
| `Chorus/Resources/` | Service catalog JSON and assets |
| `ChorusTests/` | Unit tests (pure logic: badges, validation, parsing, reordering, …) |

Architecture details live in [chorus-architecture-v2.md](chorus-architecture-v2.md).

## Notes

- The app icon is a generated placeholder; replace the images in
  `Chorus/Resources/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/` with custom artwork.
- Shipping to the Mac App Store additionally requires code signing, a
  provisioning profile, and notarization — outside the scope of this repo.
